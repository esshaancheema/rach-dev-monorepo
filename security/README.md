- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Comprehensive security posture assessment
- **GDPR Compliance** - Data protection and privacy requirements
- **SOC 2** - Security controls for service organizations

## Quick Start

### Run Complete Security Audit
```bash
./scripts/run-security-audit.sh --environment staging --comprehensive
```

### Run Penetration Tests
```bash
./scripts/run-penetration-tests.sh --target-url https://staging.zoptal.com
```

### Generate Security Report
```bash
./scripts/generate-security-report.sh --output-format html,pdf
```

## Security Metrics & KPIs

### Vulnerability Metrics
- **Critical vulnerabilities** - Immediate attention required
- **High severity issues** - Should be fixed within 7 days
- **Medium severity issues** - Should be fixed within 30 days
- **Low severity issues** - Should be fixed within 90 days

### Security Coverage
- **Code coverage** - Percentage of code covered by security tests
- **API coverage** - Percentage of API endpoints tested
- **Component coverage** - Percentage of system components assessed

### Compliance Metrics
- **OWASP Top 10 coverage** - Coverage of top security risks
- **Security control effectiveness** - Percentage of controls properly implemented
- **Remediation time** - Average time to fix security issues

## Reporting

Security test results are automatically generated in multiple formats:
- **HTML reports** - Interactive dashboards with detailed findings
- **PDF reports** - Executive summaries for stakeholders
- **JSON reports** - Machine-readable results for CI/CD integration
- **SARIF reports** - Standard format for security findings

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Security Testing
- Run automated security scans daily in CI/CD pipeline
- Perform comprehensive penetration tests monthly
- Conduct security code reviews for all changes
- Update security tools and signatures regularly

### 2. Vulnerability Management
- Prioritize fixes based on CVSS scores and business impact
- Track remediation progress with clear timelines
- Verify fixes with re-testing
- Document security decisions and trade-offs

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Implement continuous security monitoring
- Set up alerts for security events
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Track security metrics and trends

## Integration with CI/CD

Security tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    ./security/scripts/ci-security-scan.sh
    ./security/scripts/dependency-check.sh
    ./security/scripts/container-scan.sh
```
