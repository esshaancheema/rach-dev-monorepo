## ü§ñ AI Assistant

### How does the AI code generation work?
Our AI uses advanced language models (GPT-4, Claude, Codex) to understand your natural language requests and generate appropriate code. It considers:
- Your project context and existing code
- Best practices for your chosen framework
- Security and performance considerations
- Code style and conventions

### Is the AI-generated code safe to use?
Yes, but always review generated code:
- ‚úÖ AI follows security best practices
- ‚úÖ Code is tested against common vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Includes proper error handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always review before deploying to production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test thoroughly in your specific environment

### Can the AI see my private code?
- **Free/Pro plans**: AI only sees the current conversation context
- **Enterprise**: Option for fully private AI processing
- **Privacy**: We never train AI models on your private code
- **Security**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### What languages can I use with the AI?
You can communicate with the AI in:
- **English** (primary)
- **Spanish, French, German** (good support)
- **Portuguese, Italian, Dutch** (basic support)
- **More languages** being added regularly

The AI can generate code in all supported programming languages.

### Why is the AI sometimes slow to respond?
AI response time depends on:
- **Complexity** of your request
- **Server load** during peak hours
- **Your plan** (Pro users get priority)
- **Request type** (simple requests are faster)

Typical response times:
- Simple requests: 2-5 seconds
