# Zoptal Accessibility Statement

## Our Commitment to Accessibility

Zoptal is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards to ensure we provide equal access to all of our users.

## Conformance Status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

**Zoptal is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA** and partially conformant with Level AAA. Fully conformant means that the content fully satisfies all the requirements of the standard without any exceptions.

## What We've Done

We have taken the following steps to ensure the accessibility of our platform:

### Technical Measures
- **Semantic HTML**: We use proper HTML elements and structure for screen readers and other assistive technologies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality is accessible via keyboard without requiring a mouse
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual indicators show which element has keyboard focus
- **Skip Links**: Users can skip repetitive navigation to reach main content quickly
- **Alternative Text**: All images include descriptive alternative text
- **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors meet or exceed WCAG contrast requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Content adapts to different screen sizes and zoom levels up to 200%

### User Customization
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visual contrast for better readability
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion and animations
- **Font Size Scaling**: Text can be enlarged without loss of functionality
- **Color Blindness Support**: Filters to assist users with various types of color vision deficiency
- **Screen Reader Optimization**: Enhanced announcements and descriptions for screen reader users

### Content Standards
- **Clear Language**: We use plain language and avoid jargon where possible
- **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation elements are consistent across all pages
- **Descriptive Headings**: Page sections are organized with clear, descriptive headings
- **Error Prevention**: Forms include clear labels, validation, and error correction guidance
